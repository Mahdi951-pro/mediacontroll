Gesture-Controlled Media Player
Project Overview
The Gesture-Controlled Media Player is a Python-based application that allows users to control media playback using hand gestures. By utilizing advanced libraries for computer vision and gesture recognition, this project provides an intuitive and interactive way to manage media playback. Key features include play/pause, track skipping, volume control, and mute/unmute functionalitiesâ€”all controlled by hand gestures.

Features
Play/Pause Media: Toggle media playback with a specific hand gesture.
Skip Tracks: Move to the next track using gestures.
Volume Control: Adjust media volume up or down through gestures.
Mute/Unmute: Toggle mute on and off with gestures.
Gesture Feedback: Visual feedback for recognized gestures to confirm actions.
Media Player Integration: Compatible with popular media players such as VLC and Windows Media Player.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
pip: Python's package installer
PyCharm (for development)
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-controlled-media-player.git
cd gesture-controlled-media-player
Create a Virtual Environment

Creating a virtual environment is recommended:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui pyaudio
Install Additional Dependencies

Depending on your operating system, you may need to install additional libraries:

Windows: Install pyaudio for microphone access. Refer to the PyAudio Installation Guide if you encounter issues.
Linux/Mac: Install alsa-utils or equivalent for audio management.
Download Media Files

Ensure you have media files or playlists available for testing the media player.

Using PyCharm
Setting Up PyCharm
Open PyCharm

Launch PyCharm on your system.

Open the Project

Select Open from the main menu.
Navigate to the cloned repository directory and select it.
Configure the Python Interpreter

Go to File -> Settings (or PyCharm -> Preferences on macOS).
Navigate to Project: Gesture-Controlled Media Player -> Python Interpreter.
Click the gear icon and select Add.
Choose Existing environment and point to the venv directory created earlier.
Apply the changes.
Run the Application

Locate main.py in the Project Explorer.
Right-click on main.py and select Run 'main'.
Debugging

Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
Use the Debug option to start debugging and inspect variables.
Configuring PyCharm
Code Style and Formatting

Configure code style settings by going to File -> Settings -> Editor -> Code Style.
Adjust settings to match your coding standards.
Version Control Integration

Configure Git integration by going to File -> Settings -> Version Control -> Git.
Ensure your repository is properly configured for version control operations.
Usage
Running the Application
Execute the Main Script

Start the application using PyCharm or directly via the command line:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Gestures for Media Control

Play/Pause Media: Use a specific hand gesture to toggle playback.
Skip Track: Perform a gesture to advance to the next track.
Volume Control: Adjust volume with hand movements.
Mute/Unmute: Toggle mute functionality with a gesture.
Visual and Auditory Feedback

The application provides real-time visual feedback using OpenCV. You will see indicators on the screen for recognized gestures.

Customize Gestures

To customize or add new gestures, modify the gesture recognition logic in gesture_recognition.py.

Configuration
Config File: Update config.py to adjust gesture mappings, media player options, and other settings.
Media Player Integration: Ensure compatibility with your media player. Update media_player.py if necessary.
Code Structure
main.py: Main script that initializes the media player and manages gesture recognition.
media_player.py: Contains functions for controlling media playback.
gesture_recognition.py: Implements gesture recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV.
config.py: Configuration settings for gesture mappings and media player options.
Troubleshooting
Gesture Recognition Issues:

Ensure your camera is properly connected and positioned.
Verify that lighting conditions are suitable for gesture recognition.
Adjust camera angle to improve gesture detection.
Media Control Problems:

Check that your media player supports command-line controls.
Review and adjust media player integration settings in media_player.py.
Installation Errors:

Make sure all required libraries are installed correctly.
Consult specific library documentation for installation issues.
